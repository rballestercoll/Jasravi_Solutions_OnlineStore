# Jasravi Solutions OnlineStore 🛒 Java Application

## Project Overview 📋

Java application made to manage an online store. It integrates JavaFX for graphical user interfaces, Hibernate for database interactions, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The project implements design patterns such as DAO (Data Access Object) and Factory, along with the Singleton pattern for resource utilization.

## Key Technologies & Patterns 💻

- **Database:** MySQL
- **GUI Framework:** JavaFX
- **Persistence:** Hibernate (JPA - Java Persistence API)
- **Testing:** JUnit
- **Architecture:**
  - MVC (Model-View-Controller)
  - Design Patterns:
    - DAO and Factory for efficient data access
    - Singleton to ensure a single instance of essential classes

## Security Measures 🔐

To ensure robust security:

- **JDBC Best Practices:** Implemented to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
- **Transactions and Stored Procedures:** Applied in all Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.
